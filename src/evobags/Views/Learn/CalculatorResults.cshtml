    Based on the fact that you will use <b>@ViewData["NumCases"]</b> cases of Evolution Trash Bags, we have calculated that you will
    have reduced the amount of greenhouse gases by <b>@ViewData["GHGReduction"] metric tons in one year!</b>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This is equivalent to removing <b>@ViewData["CarsRemoved"] passenger vehicles</b> from the road each year.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>@ViewData["Trees"]</b> Seedlings would need to be planted and grow for 10 years!</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>With the amount of greenhouse gases reduced by your usage of Evolution Trash Bags, <br />you could power <b>@ViewData["HomesPowered"] homes</b> for one year!</p>
